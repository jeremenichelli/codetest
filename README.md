Test for VP using ajax call for search engine.

This is a simple website with a logo and a search form in which you can look for products.

This data is obtain using Etsy API. I've used jQuery to simplify the JSONP Ajax call and a sortable plug-in in order to allow the user to change how the products are being shown. For that there's a handler icon on the left of every product row. There's also an external link, so the user can see the product single page.

On the right of every row you can find a Remove button to delete the item from the list, a View description button to slide down a paragraph with more information about the product itself.
